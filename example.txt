In twilight's gentle, fading hue,
Where dreams take flight, both old and new,
The stars above, a shimmering sea,
Whisper secrets to you and me.

As night unfolds its velvet cloak,
In whispered words, the universe spoke,
A symphony of light and grace,
In this tranquil, cosmic space.

So, gaze upon the night's grand art,
Let wonder fill your longing heart,
For in the silence, you will find,
A universe of dreams, entwined.
